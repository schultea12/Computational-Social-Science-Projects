    "This project aims to predict diabetes rates in U.S. counties using machine learning models. We explored the dataset, built several models (OLS, Ridge, LASSO), evaluated their performance, and selected the model that best fit the data and relevant problem (Ridge). I would initially priortize the pilot program for counties in the South and Southeast, particularly Alabama, South Carolina, and West Virginia, given these areas have the highest diabetes numbers. By targeting counties with the highest predicted diabetes rates, the pilot program can focus resources where they will likely have the biggest impact. \n",

    "My answers may change if we take features such as race, gender, or age into account, although the correlation analysis showed that several of these variables were not correlated with the outcomes. For example, the \"sex and age_total population_median age (years)\" variable only had a correlation value of 0.043229. Additionally, many of the tribal grouping variables had low correlation. It is also important to note that correlations do not imply causation. While the model can identify associations between certain features and diabetes rates, it does not prove causal relationships.\n",

    "I am not very confident in deploying this model in a real-world application because I feel like there are other, more complex methods (that we may learn later in the semester) that would give more accurate and nuanced predictions. For example, I'm not sure if I did the appropriate procedure for the feature selection at the beginning and obviously got strange results with the lasso feature selection process, so I'd like to better understand how to choose the best / most important features to include in the prediction model. However, if we did deploy the model in a real-world setting, it would be crucial to ensure  continuous monitoring and evaluation to assess its effectiveness and adapt interventions as needed."
